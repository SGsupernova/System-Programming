1. The Method of Compilation
Just type 'make'.
$ make

2. The Method of Execution
After compilation, type './20141570.out'
$ ./20141570.out

3. How to test filename(tokenizer)
	gcc -D DEBUG filename.c -o filename.out


In shell,
   you can type these command
	- h[elp]
	- d[ir]
	- q[uit]
	- hi[story]
	- du[mp] [start, end]
	- e[dit] address, value
	- f[ill] start, end, value
	- reset
	- opcode mnemonic
	- opcodelist
	- assemble filename
	- type filename
	- symbol
	- progaddr [address]
	- loader [object filename1] [object filename2] [...]\n");
	- run
	- bp [address]
	- bp clear


	When if you type bp, then the SHELL shows all break points.
	[object filename]'s extension is only allowed ".obj"


	If you do not type as the form suggested, this shell does not execute the command you want and prints the error message.
